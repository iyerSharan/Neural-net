Some insight :
Uses: pyTorch

This code is taken from an online datacamp website to use the scikit-learn toy dataset to make circle and train the
model to meet a classical classification challenge on an unseen dataset. The test will predict which circle the dataset
belongs to. The dataset creates a circles, one big outer circle and another inner circle, and there are labels containing
which circle the datapoint belongs to :).
